I'm the founder of [apiobuild](http://apiobuild.com/), a tech platform empower aspiring human beings to build from 0 to 1 and support them as they grow.

Whether you are fundraising, starting an online business, running for office, the most difficult step is the first step. Our platform simplifies complex workflows to help small businesses, nonprofits, politicians and many more to build from scratch.

Prior to [apiobuild](http://apiobuild.com/), I've spent 8+ years in event production at various nonprofits with a focus in LGBTQ+ community, immigrants, women's right and underrepresented communities.
