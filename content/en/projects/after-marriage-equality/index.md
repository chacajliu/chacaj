In May 2019, Taiwan became the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage. Taiwanese playwrights, Chao Chi-Yun (趙啟運), Lin Meng-Huan (林孟寰), and Liu Chien-Kuo (劉建幗) have created short plays embracing the achievements and struggles of this historic moment. Directed by Michael Leibenluft of Gung Ho Projects. The readings was followed by a discussion with the playwrights, curators, director, and translator Jeremy Tiang moderated by Linnea Valdivia, Literary Manager for the National Queer Theater.
