Pride Voices featured excerpted readings from *The Possible Memoirs of a Traitor* by Li-Ying Chien (directed by Knud Adams) and *Solo Date* by Pao-Chang Tsai (directed and performed by Tsai; dramaturgy by Soriya Chum).Through their plays and stage works Chien and Tsai have reinvigorated the Taiwanese theatre-scape. Blending new media, real-life event, and various performative techniques, their highly political and engaged works give voice to an emerging cultural movement in Taiwan. As established queer artists, their creative processes and cultural productions also shed light on the struggles and achievements of the LGBTQ community in Taiwan and Asia today.

These plays were invited to [International Voices Project Chicago](https://www.ivpchicago.org/) in 2019.
