*The Broken Record* written by Jonathan Louis Dent and directed by Megan Sandberg-Zakian, examines the violence between black youth and police officers in the United States, exposing the fury, helplessness, and grief we feel watching these stories play on repeat, and asking: how can these fatal encounters finally be stopped?
