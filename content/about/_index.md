Experienced public event producer with a focus on inclusiveness and diversity. While theater and art is one form of promoting these ideas, I am looking for opportunity to work in fields that can expose these ideas and values to broader audience and have more critical impact.

I have coordinated over 300+ public events and up to 10000+ attendance. Conferences, talks, and plays promoting public awareness on gender and race diversity, social mobility, LGBTQ rights. Speakers and playwrights including first Asian American female playwright on Broadway Young Jean Lee, internationally acclaimed Robert Lepage, well known Theatrologist Dr. Marvin Carlson, among others.

Experience working in small organization and exposed to variety of office operations, fundraising, office management, HR, social and digital marketing, developing international artists, students and volunteer community. Strong technical and analytical aptitude - finished multiple web-development and data science online courses on Udacity (Google scholarship) and Coursera. 

I have MPA in Public Administration and Arts Management from SUNY Brockport (Rochester, NY, 2014) and BA in Political Science from National Chengchi University (Taipei, Taiwan, 2012). With solid training and social science and research methodology, I am extremely analytical and passionate about promoting important social values.
